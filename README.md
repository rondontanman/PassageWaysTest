**Comments**
By no means is this perfect, and but I think it shows enough of my ability for the time I put into the project. 
I also misread the instructions/tasks thinking it said create an API for meetings not RSVPs... I'll take the blame on that one.

I chose to use .Net Core and Vue just because I was creating it from scratch (something I have only done once or twice to be honest).

**GitHub Issues**
I also was having trouble connecting my GitHub profile with my files. My main PC wouldn't let me upload anything due to my Plastic Source Control. So I created a zip and through it to my Mac. But even there I had some issues... so really all of the files under the public, src, and tests folders should be in a frontend folder.

Lastly, I had test folders and start of the nuget packages started for it but I really wanted to just see how much I could get done in the 6-7 hours I was allocating for this. 

**Thanks!**
Either way thanks for the opportunity! If my quality isn't good enough for your lead role I would be more than willing to join at a lower role and work my way up on this new team. I think I have some good skills and by no means are they perfect. But I am willing to learn and eager to do my best for you guys if you are willing to give me the chance. Talk to you soon!
